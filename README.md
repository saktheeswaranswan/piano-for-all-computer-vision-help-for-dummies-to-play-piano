this methsod of learmnig will not make you lazy but gives the big picture of music and i want to deticate my invention
to kamal hassan and illayaraja both have an phenomenal genius in them 
so I name this method of computer vision aided music learning and playin as
#kamal en raja cv method music learning 
#கமல் என் ராஜா cv method music learning (computer vision method)
#kamla is kamal hassan has 
raja for illay raja the king of music
en means both are my king
piano for all computer vision help for dummies,kids and ,noobs to play piano  to play piano

please specify duration and note is csv correctly 

This is a code for a basic piano playing experience using computer vision techniques, designed specifically for noobs, beginners and dummies. The code is based on identifying the keys being played and mapping them to the corresponding notes. This version of the code is a basic one, and it does not involve chords. The code is available on GitHub, licensed under the MIT License, which allows for free use, modification and distribution of the code.

The code requires the specification of the note and duration in a CSV file. In the case of incorrect specification, the code might show some errors. The code is open for future contributions and modifications, and the key mapping can be adjusted to include more notes. The goal of this project is to create a beginner-friendly piano playing experience, and as the code evolves, it will incorporate more advanced features such as chord recognition.

In terms of development time, building this code took approximately 10-20 hours, depending on the experience of the developer. This includes planning, coding, testing and debugging. The code is written in Python, making use of computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy. The code is designed to be easily readable and understandable, even for those with little to no programming experience.

In conclusion, this code is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn more about computer vision techniques and how they can be used to create a fun and interactive experience. The open-source nature of the code and the MIT License makes it possible for anyone to contribute to the project and add new features. The code is a simple yet effective tool for playing the piano, and with time and contributions from the community, it can become a more advanced and feature-rich tool for anyone interested in playing the piano.
