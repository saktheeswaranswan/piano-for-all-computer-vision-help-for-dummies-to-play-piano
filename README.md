 To arrange the piano keys in order of the piano notes of an Ilayaraja Nayagan song, follow these steps:

Determine the key signature of the song, as Ilayaraja's music often contains complex musical structures and various musical modes.

Identify the musical scale of the song by recognizing the melody and chords used in the song.

Write down the notes in the order that they appear in the song, either by transcribing the melody by ear or by using sheet music.

Order the notes in ascending or descending order, depending on the melody and chord progression of the song.

Map the notes to the corresponding piano keys, taking into account the key signature and any accidentals used in the song.

Label each key with its corresponding note name, and arrange them in the order determined in step 4.

Practice playing the arrangement of keys on the piano to ensure that it accurately reflects the notes of the Ilayaraja Nayagan song.

Repeat the process for other songs or compositions by Ilayaraja as desired.

Note: The above steps are just a general guide and the actual process may vary depending on the complexity and style of the Ilayaraja Nayagan song. It is always a good idea to consult with a music teacher or use musical reference books and resources to help you with the arrangement process.

tell me what duration can each note can be played in an 32 keyboard piano
The duration of each note can vary in an 32-key keyboard piano, as it depends on the tempo and rhythm of the piece being played. However, in Western music, the most common durations for notes are:

Whole note: 4 beats
Half note: 2 beats
Quarter note: 1 beat
Eighth note: 1/2 beat
Sixteenth note: 1/4 beat
It is important to note that these durations are just guidelines, and the actual duration of a note can be adjusted based on the performer's interpretation of the piece. Additionally, some pieces may use different time signatures, which will affect the duration of the notes.

tell them and list them in terms of mill seconds  for each piano note 
In music notation, the duration of a note is indicated by its shape and stem direction, as well as by the presence or absence of flags or beams. The duration of a note can also be specified in terms of beats, which are the units of time in a musical measure.

To specify the duration of a note in milliseconds, you would need to know the tempo, or speed, at which the music is being played. In a 3/4 time signature, a quarter note receives one beat and has a duration of 1/4 of a measure. The duration of each note in milliseconds would then be calculated based on the number of beats it receives and the tempo of the music.

For example, if the tempo is set at 120 beats per minute, a quarter note would have a duration of 500 milliseconds (60,000 milliseconds ÷ 120 beats per minute ÷ 4 quarter notes per beat). The duration of other notes, such as half notes and eighth notes, would be calculated relative to the quarter note.

Here is a list of the durations of the notes in milliseconds, based on a tempo of 120 beats per minute in a 3/4 time signature:

C#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
C#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
B: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
A: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
G#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
A: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
B: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
A: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
G#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
E: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
G#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
A: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
G#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
E: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)

F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
C#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
C#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
G#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
E: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
F#: 500 milliseconds (1 quarter note)
It's important to note that the actual duration of each note may vary depending on the interpretation and style of the music being played. Additionally, the tempo can be changed to affect the duration of the notes.

quarter note, full note ,hole note list all notes in music sheet
In sheet music, there are several types of notes, including:

Quarter note (crotchet) - A quarter note is played for one beat in a 4/4 time signature. It is represented by a filled-in note head and a stem.

Half note (minim) - A half note is played for two beats in a 4/4 time signature. It is represented by an open note head and a stem.

Whole note (semibreve) - A whole note is played for four beats in a 4/4 time signature. It is represented by an open note head with no stem.

Eighth note (quaver) - An eighth note is played for one-half beat in a 4/4 time signature. It is represented by a filled-in note head with a stem and a flag or beam.

Sixteenth note (semi-quaver) - A sixteenth note is played for one-quarter beat in a 4/4 time signature. It is represented by a filled-in note head with a stem, two flags or beams.

Thirty-second note (demi-quaver) - A thirty-second note is played for one-eighth beat in a 4/4 time signature. It is represented by a filled-in note head with a stem, three flags or beams.

Dotted note - A dotted note is a note that is held for one and a half times its normal value. A dotted quarter note, for example, is held for one beat and one half of a beat.

Tie - A tie is used to connect two notes of the same pitch to be played as one sustained sound.

Rest - A rest is a period of silence in sheet music. There are several types of rests, including quarter rests, half rests, and whole rests, which correspond to the different types of notes.

take all the notes above and list them in milliseconds to be played for 3/4 and 4/4 signatures
In musical notation, the duration of a note is indicated by its shape and position on the staff. A quarter note, for example, is typically written as a filled-in oval and is played for one quarter of the duration of a whole note. A whole note is written as an open circle and is played for the full duration of a measure. A half note is written as a filled-in oval with a stem, and is played for half the duration of a whole note.

To determine the duration of each note in milliseconds for a given tempo, you'll need to know the tempo (in beats per minute) and the time signature. For example, if the tempo is 60 beats per minute (BPM) and the time signature is 3/4, each quarter note would be played for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) divided by 60 beats per minute, or 1000/60 = 16.67 milliseconds. To find the duration of a whole note, you would multiply the duration of a quarter note by 4.

Here's how the notes "C# C# B A F# G# A B A B A G# E F# G# A A G# E F# F# F# C# F# F# F# C# F# F# F# G# E F# F# F# F#" would be played in 3/4 time at 60 BPM:

Quarter note: 16.67 milliseconds
Half note: 33.33 milliseconds
Whole note: 66.67 milliseconds

And here's how they would be played in 4/4 time at 60 BPM:

Quarter note: 16.67 milliseconds
Half note: 33.33 milliseconds
Whole note: 66.67 milliseconds

Note that these durations are based on the assumption of a tempo of 60 BPM. The actual duration of each note will depend on the tempo and time signature being used in your piece of music.
